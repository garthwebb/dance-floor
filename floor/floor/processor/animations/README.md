# Converting Piskel Files

To convert \*.c [Piskel](http://www.piskelapp.com/) animation files to \*.py animation files readable by this software, use the `convert-piskel.pl` script.  For a file named `raditaing.c`, the command would be:

```bash
$ bin/convert-piskel.pl --file processor/animations/radiating.c 
```

This will create a file named `radiating.py` in the same directory as `radiating.c`.
